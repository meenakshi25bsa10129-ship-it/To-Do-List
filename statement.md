📄 Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced world, individuals often struggle with managing multiple tasks and commitments. Without an organized system, it's easy to forget important duties, leading to missed deadlines, decreased productivity, and increased stress. Many existing solutions are either too complex for simple daily use or require internet access and elaborate setups. There is a clear need for a straightforward, easily accessible, and intuitive tool to help users track and prioritize their daily tasks effectively, without unnecessary overhead.

🎯 Scope of the Project
This project focuses on developing a fundamental, text-based To-Do List application. The scope is limited to essential task management functionalities within a console environment. It will allow users to perform core operations such as adding new tasks, viewing their current list of tasks, and removing completed or unwanted tasks. Data persistence will be maintained for the duration of a single session, meaning tasks will be lost upon application exit. Future enhancements like saving to a file, marking tasks as complete, or setting due dates are outside the initial scope.

👥 Target Users
The primary target users for this To-Do List application are:

Students: Who need a quick way to list assignments, study topics, or personal errands.
Individuals seeking simplicity: Users who find graphical interfaces or feature-rich applications overwhelming and prefer a minimalist approach to task management.
Developers/IT Professionals: Who are comfortable with command-line interfaces and need a light-weight tool for tracking minor coding tasks, reminders, or project steps.
Anyone needing a basic digital scratchpad: For temporary task tracking without the need for advanced features or cloud synchronization.
✨ High-Level Features
Task Addition: Users can easily input and append new tasks to their personal to-do list.
Task Listing: All current tasks are displayed in an organized, numbered format for clear overview.
Task Deletion: Users have the ability to remove specific tasks from the list based on their index.
Interactive Menu: A simple, intuitive command-line menu guides users through available actions.
Session-Based Data: Tasks are managed in memory during the application's runtime.
